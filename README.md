# Degrees-of-separation
Degrees of separation apart two actors
## Overview
The "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" is a game based on the concept that any actor in Hollywood can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps through co-starring roles in movies. This project implements a program to find the shortest path between two actors based on the movies they have starred in.
## Background
The "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" is a parlor game based on the idea that any two people on Earth can be connected through a chain of acquaintances with no more than five intermediaries. In the context of Hollywood, the game posits that any actor can be linked to Kevin Bacon through co-starring roles in films within six steps.

This concept gained popularity in the mid-1990s after a group of students at Albright College developed the game as a variant of the "Erd≈ës number" (a similar concept applied to mathematicians connected by co-authorship of academic papers). The game's name is a play on the idea of "six degrees of separation," a theory suggesting that everyone is six or fewer steps away from any other person in the world.

In this project, exploring the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept computationally. By leveraging data from IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), we seek to build a program capable of finding the shortest path between any two actors based on their shared appearances in movies. Our goal is to provide an interactive tool that allows users to discover the cinematic connections between their favorite actors and Kevin Bacon.
